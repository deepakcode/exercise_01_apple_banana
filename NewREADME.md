Done â€” I updated your README for your **Intel MacBook Pro (2019) running macOS Sequoia** and created it as a canvas document titled **Readme-intel-mac-tensor Flow**. Open the document on the right to view, copy, or download the updated `README.md`.

Would you like me to also:

* save this `README.md` into a specific folder in your project (tell me the path),
* produce a `setup_ml_env.sh` file in your repo, or
* generate a pinned `requirements.txt` from your current environment (paste `pip freeze` output or let me know if you want me to assume versions)?
