#Fix:

Ah, I see the problem ðŸ‘€

You accidentally **committed your whole virtual environment (`my_ml_env/`)** to Git.
That includes big binaries like TensorFlowâ€™s `.dylib` files (hundreds of MB). GitHub blocks files >100 MB.

---

## âœ… Fix

### 1. Remove the virtual environment from Git tracking

Run these commands in your project root:

```bash
# Remove venv from Git index (but keep it locally)
git rm -r --cached my_ml_env/

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove virtual environment from repo"
```

---

### 2. Add `my_ml_env/` to `.gitignore`

Create or edit `.gitignore` in your repo root and add:

```
# Ignore virtual environments
my_ml_env/
```

Also add other generated stuff you donâ€™t want in Git:

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
```

Commit that too:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to ignore venv and temp files"
```

---

### 3. Push again

```bash
git push
```

Now it should succeed, since the large files are no longer being tracked.

---

## âš¡ Why this works

* Virtual environments (`my_ml_env/`) should **never be committed** to Git â€” they contain binaries and are platform-specific.
* Instead, only commit your **source code + requirements.txt**.
* Anyone else can recreate the venv using:

  ```bash
  python3.11 -m venv my_ml_env
  source my_ml_env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also give you a **ready-to-use `.gitignore` file for Python ML projects** (covers venvs, Jupyter notebooks, cache files, etc.) so you donâ€™t hit this again?
